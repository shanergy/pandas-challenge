    "* Charter-type schools within the PyCity School District outperform their district-type school counterparts in every standardized test result metric – and by a large margin in nearly every single one, notably the average math scores as well as percent of students passing math, reading and tests overall.  The top 5 performing schools are all charter-type schools while the bottom 5 are district-type schools.  Not a single district-type school had a higher math, reading or overall passing rate than the district average.  \n",

The reason why would be worth studying more in depth to see what best practices are utilized that might be able to be implemented in district-type schools improve standardized test score performance and results.\n"

I tried for a bit to figure it out, but found myself going down a rabbit hole and wasting time to figure it out.  I'm wondering if it's syntax, or perhaps a version of conda that I'm running is different than that with which the example code was ran and saved I pulled from the repository (when I re-run the solved class activities, they first appear in bold as saved, but are converted to standard font when run the script).  Any help or recommendation you might have would be appreciated!\n",

I ended up having to merge/join different datasets together, but tried over and over to do it by group by.  Any thoughts or feedback you have on this too would also be appreciated!\n",
    "* I noticed the “Scores by School Spending”, “Scores by School Size” and “Scores by School Type”, aggregations in the example appear to be average of averages (averages of each school’s average that falls within each bin/bucket).  I first started to average including all students so it was a true average, but my figures weren’t matching, so I completed the script to match the examples.  There wasn’t a huge difference in the figures, but was wondering if there was a reason or better to do it that way?  \n",
